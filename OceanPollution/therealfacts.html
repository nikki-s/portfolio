 <h1>Reel in the Facts</h1>
<h2>Make shore you know your facts!</h2>
 
 <p>Plastic is the most common pollutant.</p>
<p>Over one million seabirds are killed by ocean pollution each year. Three hundred thousand dolphins and porpoises die each year as a result of becoming entangled in discarded fishing nets, among other items. One hundred thousand sea mammals are killed in the ocean by pollution each year.</p>
<p>Oil is the fastest source of deterioration to the ocean, being far more harmful than trash and waste.</p>
<p>People get contaminated easily by eating contaminated seafood that can cause serious health problems, from cancer to damage to immune system.</p>
<p>There is more microplastic in the ocean than there are stars in the Milky Way.</p>
